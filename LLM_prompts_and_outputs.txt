To get the results of Tiny-Llama for this experiment, execute LLM_output_test.py.
To get the results of Qwen3, do the following:
1. Use this link in your browser: https://huggingface.co/chat/settings/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B
2. During this test, when it asks for a hugging face account, log in or create an account and confirm your email address.
3. Click on: New chat
4. Copy the corresponding prompt and paste it in the prompt box (where it says: ask anything)
5. The prompt box will be empty, but the pasted prompt can be seen as pasted content above the prompt box.
6. To generate an answer, type: continue, in the prompt box and hit enter.
7. Afterwards you should see the output of the LLM.


Prompt 3
Role:
You are an AI that simulates an environment for model based reinforcement learning.
          
Environment Rules:
The agent is in a 5×5 grid maze with states numbered from 1 to 25, structured as follows:
Top-left corner: State 1.
Top-right corner: State 5.
Bottom-left corner: State 21.
Bottom-right corner: State 25.
The agent moves up, down, left, or right, but cannot move outside the grid.
Each move results in a reward of -1 unless otherwise specified.
Use past interactions if available.


If the action is new, apply logical reasoning based on the grid structure:   
Moving left decreases the state number by 1, unless at the left boundary.
Moving right increases the state number by 1, unless at the right boundary.
Moving up decreases the state by 5, unless at the top boundary.
Moving down increases the state by 5, unless at the bottom boundary.
Circumstance at the beginning of the line means that YOU should reason with the effect the wind could have on the outcome of the action.


You must return the following after an action:
state, location, action, reward, next_state, next_location.
                    
Past Interactions:
    Context: The action from a certain state might result in a different next_state than the following action because of environment circumstanses.
    In case this happens, write: "Circumstance" in the output.

Prompt 6.5
Role:
You are an AI that simulates an environment for model based reinforcement learning.
          
Environment Rules:
The agent is in a 5×5 grid maze with states numbered from 1 to 25, structured as follows:
Top-left corner: State 1.
Top-right corner: State 5.
Bottom-left corner: State 21.
Bottom-right corner: State 25.
The agent moves up, down, left, or right, but cannot move outside the grid.
Each move results in a reward of -1 unless otherwise specified.
Use past interactions if available.


If the action is new, apply logical reasoning based on the grid structure:   
Moving left decreases the state number by 1, unless at the left boundary.
Moving right increases the state number by 1, unless at the right boundary.
Moving up decreases the state by 5, unless at the top boundary.
Moving down increases the state by 5, unless at the bottom boundary.
Circumstance at the beginning of the line means that YOU should reason with the effect the wind could have on the outcome of the action.


You must return the following after an action:
state, location, action, reward, next_state, next_location.
                    
Past Interactions:
    Context: The action from a certain state might result in a different next_state than the following action because of environment circumstanses.
    In case this happens, write: "Circumstance" in the output.

Prompt 9
Role:
You are an AI that simulates an environment for model based reinforcement learning.
          
Environment Rules:
The agent is in a 5×5 grid maze with states numbered from 0 to 24, structured as follows:
Top-left corner: State 0.
Top-right corner: State 4.
Bottom-left corner: State 20.
Bottom-right corner: State 24.
The agent moves up, down, left, or right, but cannot move outside the grid.
Each move results in a reward of -1 unless otherwise specified.
Use past interactions if available.


If the action is new, apply logical reasoning based on the grid structure:   
Moving left decreases the state number by 1, unless at the left boundary.
Moving right increases the state number by 1, unless at the right boundary.
Moving up decreases the state by 5, unless at the top boundary.
Moving down increases the state by 5, unless at the bottom boundary.
Circumstance at the beginning of the line means that YOU should reason with the effect the wind could have on the outcome of the action.


You must return the following after an action:
state, location, action, reward, next_state, next_location.
                    
Past Interactions:
    Context: The action from a certain state might result in a different next_state than the following action because of environment circumstanses.
    In case this happens, write: "Circumstance" in the output.

Prompt 12.5
"Role:
You are an AI that simulates an environment for model based reinforcement learning.
          
Environment Rules:
The agent is in a 5×5 grid maze with states numbered from 0 to 24, structured as follows:
Top-left corner: State 0.
Top-right corner: State 4.
Bottom-left corner: State 20.
Bottom-right corner: State 24.
The agent moves up, down, left, or right, but cannot move outside the grid.
Each move results in a reward of -1 unless otherwise specified.
Use past interactions if available.


If the action is new, apply logical reasoning based on the grid structure:   
Moving left decreases the state number by 1, unless at the left boundary.
Moving right increases the state number by 1, unless at the right boundary.
Moving up decreases the state by 5, unless at the top boundary.
Moving down increases the state by 5, unless at the bottom boundary.
Circumstance at the beginning of the line means that YOU should reason with the effect the wind could have on the outcome of the action.


You must return the following after an action:
state, location, action, reward, next_state, next_location.
                    
Past Interactions:
    Context: The action from a certain state might result in a different next_state than the following action because of environment circumstanses.
    In case this happens, write: "Circumstance" in the output.
